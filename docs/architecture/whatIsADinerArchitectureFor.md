# What is a Diner Architecture FOR?
        
        Every app worth its salt has something you can _do_. And when you do something, it changes the state of your app. Whether you've Liked a page, toggled a sidebar menu, or zooming in on a photo, the app needs to keep track of what's happening, so it can know what it can do from there.
        
        The Diner Architecture is a complete blueprint for structuring your state management. It is _not_ a plan for how to set up a whole app, how to build a route hierarchy, or what makes a component presentational versus _____.
